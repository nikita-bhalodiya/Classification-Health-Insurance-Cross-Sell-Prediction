**Project Summary:**

**1) Loading Data :**

     1. Importing libraries
     2. Dataset Loading
     3. Dataset Information

**2) Data Wrangling and Exploratory data analysis(EDA) :**

     1. Univariate Analysis:

             1. Distribution of Dependent variable Response
             2. Distribution of Age
             3. Distribution of Previously_Insured
             4. Distribution of  Annual_Preminum
             5. Distribution of Vehicle_Damage
             6. Distribution of Vehicle_Age

      2. Bivariate analysis:
             1. Visualisation of Age VS Response
             2. Visualisation of Gender Vs Response
             3. Visualisation of Vehicle Age and Customer Respons
             4.  Visualisation of Annual_Premium Vs Response

**3) Cleaning Data :**

        1. Handling Null Values
        2. Handling Duplicate Values
        3. Remove Outlier

**4) Feature Engineering**

**5) Pre processing of the data**

**6) Model implementation**


**Execution Instructions:**

1) Download data TRAIN-HEALTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION.csv file from following:
   https://www.kaggle.com/code/tanujdhiman/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction/input?select=train.csv
   
3) Download Colab notebook from following:

4) Laod dataset, Data Wrangling and Exploratory data analysis(EDA) by Univariate Analysis and Bivariate analysis, Feature Engineering and data Preprocessing and model implementation
   
5) Apply Binary classification algorithms:
   1) **Logistic Regression:**

   3) **Random Forest:**

   5)  **XGBClassifier:**

6) Evaluate model using evaluation metrics like Recall score, Precision score, F1 score,Accuracy score and ROC Accuracy score 

     For the logistic regression we got an accuracy of 78% and for the XGBClassifier we got the aacuracy of 80%. We are getting the highest accuracy of about 91% and ROC_AUC score of 92% with random forest. So, 
     From this I can say that random forest is the best models as compare to the other models.
